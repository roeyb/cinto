To use this you need a 32-bit version of python 2.6 or python 2.7 for win32.

If you use another platform, you have to compile fluidsynth yourself and put it in the lib directory.

Run cinto.py for a demo music sequence.

For using the web service, you need to install tornado. You can get the win32 version from this page:
http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/

Then just run service.py
and go to http://localhost:8888/ in your web browser.
